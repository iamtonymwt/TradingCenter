# Trading Center

a backend web service for a trading center. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do the following things:

- Create and manage accounts.
- Record all balance changes to each of the accounts.
- Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts.

The programming language is Golang. This whole project is presented in 4 sections:

1. Designed PostgreSQL DB using DBML, and generated Golang code to interact with DB without deadlock.

2. Built 7 RESTful HTTP APIs using Gin and wrote stronger tests using Gomock with 100% coverage.

3. Built Docker image and deployed the app to AWS Kubernetes cluster (EKS) automatically in less than 50s.

4. Used Redis as message queue, create and send emails to users via Gmail SMTP server.
